## How can I test if the Akismet anti-spam configuration is in effect?

Please fill in `viagra-test-123` as a nickname, or `akismet-guaranteed-spam@example.com` as an email address to post a comment, which will definitely be considered as a spam comment.

Note that due to the slow response time of the Akismet service (about 6 seconds), which affects the user experience, Twikoo adopts a "release first, detect later" policy, and spam comments will be visible for a short time after they are posted.

## How are free resources calculated?

[环境总览](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcb/env/overview)See resource usage. twikoo consumes **database** and **cloud functions**, both with a free usage of -

* Database: 50,000 reads/day, 50,000 writes/day
* Cloud functions: 40,000 GBs/month

The memory consumption of Twikoo cloud functions is constant at 0.1GB, which means that Twikoo cloud functions have a running time of up to 400,000 seconds per month, and the bottleneck of free resources is mainly in the daily read limit of the database. It is recommended that webmasters pay attention to the usage of free resources.

## How do I enable Katex support?

Twikoo supports Katex formulas, but to limit the package size of Twikoo, Twikoo does not have the full Katex built-in, you need to [load katex.js additionally in the page](https://katex.org/docs/browser.html).

example

``` html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-AfEj0r4/OFrOo5t7NnNe46zW/tFgW6x/bCJG8FqQCEo3+Aro6EYUG4+cU+KJWu/X" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.js" integrity="sha384-g7c+Jr9ZivxKLnZTDUhnkOnsh30B4H0rpLUpJ4jAIKs4fnJI+sEnkvrMWph2EDg4" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js" integrity="sha384-mll67QQFJfxn0IYznZYonOWZ644AWYC+Pt2cHqMaRhXVrursRwvLnLaebdGIlYNa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
```

After loading, you can send `$$c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$` to test the effect.

You can also pass in a custom katex configuration during `twikoo.init`, see [Katex Auto-render Extension](https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html) for details.

``` js
twikoo.init({
  envId: 'Environment id',
  el: '#tcomment',
  katex: {
    delimiters: [
      { left: '$$', right: '$$', display: true },
      { left: '$', right: '$', display: false },
      { left: '\\(', right: '\\)', display: false },
      { left: '\\[', right: '\\]', display: true }
    ],
    throwOnError: false
  }
});
```

## How to configure anti-spam?

Tencent Cloud text content detection is a paid service, offering a 1-month free trial, after which the price is 25 RMB per 10,000 entries. If you don't have high requirements for anti-spam comments, you can also use the free Akismet.

### Using Akismet Anti-Spam Service

2. Select Akismet Personal subscription, copy the Akismet API Key and configure it in the Twikoo admin panel "Anti-Spam" module

## Error encountered in login administration panel AUTH_INVALID_CUSTOM_LOGIN_TICKET

Generally, after configuring the login private key, the login private key is downloaded again, which causes the previously configured login private key to be invalid.<br>
Solution: Go to [Cloud Development Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcb/database/collection/config), database, delete the config, and then reconfigure the private key.

## Can't receive emails?

If it is a cloud function deployed by Vercel, please configure foreign mail service providers to avoid being judged as spam behavior by mail service providers. If it is other reasons, please go to Twikoo management panel, find mail test function, enter your personal mailbox and troubleshoot the reasons according to the test results.

In order to avoid performance problems caused by frequent mailbox checking, the mail configuration has a cache of about 10 minutes, if you are sure the configuration is fine but the test fails, you can wait for 10 minutes and then test again.

## Vercel can't upload images?

The Tencent Cloud environment comes with cloud storage, so you can upload images directly in the Tencent Cloud environment, and the images are saved in the cloud storage. However, Vercel environment does not, the upload image function relies on third party image bed, please configure the image bed in the admin panel, Twikoo supports the following image bed:

| Bed | Address | Features |

| qcloud | None | Tencent Cloud environment comes with it, can be viewed in Cloud Development - Cloud Storage |
| 7bu | https://7bu.top | Go to No Bed, powered by 杜老师, no free packages |
| smms | https://sm.ms | SMMS image bed, there is a free package, please register your account, `IMAGE_CDN_TOKEN` can be obtained in [Dashboard](https://sm.ms/home/apitoken) |
| [lsky-pro](https://www.lsky.pro) | Private Deployment | LankenGraphics 2.0 version, `IMAGE_CDN` please configure the URL address of the home page of the graph bed (such as `https://7bu.top`), `IMAGE_CDN_TOKEN` get way please refer to the tutorial [杜老师 said the graph bed: new version Go not to the bed Token acquisition and emptying](https://dusays.com/454/), the format of the obtained token should be `1\|1bJbwlqBfnggmOMEZqXT5XusaIwqiZjCDs7r1Ob5`) |

## Can it be deployed privately?

No. If you do need to support private deployment of the comment system, please prioritize other comment systems.

You can see the progress of private deployment in this project [twikoo-docker](https://github.com/twikoojs/twikoo-docker). There are a number of issues with private deployments that the authors do not have the time and energy to address at this stage. Feel free to contribute.
